FRONTEND
Use a ​ mobile-first​ approach.
Use localStorage API for storing any type of data.
No frameworks are compulsory, however if you believe any framework makes the
implementation more modular, we expect you to use it.
Use ES2015+ features -(Use the latest features of JavaScript, if possible)
EASY
1. Create a quiz game that takes multiple answers and shows a result to the user.
Specific features of the app should include:
➢ Tougher questions as the quiz progresses if the user is entering correct
answers.
➢ Must be easier to add another question to the questions set.
2. Create a web app which uses a search input and any API(s) of your choice to
display gifs on a page.
Specific features of the app should include:➢ Users must be able to search for gifs based on Character Name,
Emotion, why even name of TV series.
➢ The homepage should have recommended gifs based on search history.
HARD
Highest preference is given to UI.
1. Build a catalog page for a shop. A catalog page describes what products are
available in the shop. Use some build tool (Gulp, npm, Webpack, etc) to bundle
your files if you are using a framework.
Implement the following features:
➢ Have a big catalog file. For each item on the catalog, the following
information must be present on the page:
○ Image
○ Name
○ Price
○ Available Sizes
○ Quantity available
➢ Have a search bar to search for products.
➢ Have a cart where items can be added, and number of items can be
changed.
➢ It must be possible to view the cart with the items you've added (name,
image, price, quantity) and the grand total.
➢ The cart should be persisted between reloads.
➢ Work on a recommender system based on the users choices (complexity
and efficiency of the algorithm will be evaluated).
➢ The application should be very fast, and should not occupy excessive
memory footprint in the browser.
➢ Extra points if it could be implemented as a Progressive Web App. (PWA)
